# Things which we might like to do

* Split player.js up into individual modules. This is simple now that we
  build with webpack.
* Share code with the CUDL viewer once it has a webpack build.
* Use a consistent name for the viewer/player (rather than viewer/player)

## Speculative

* Allow specifying a specific region & rotation of a page to start at
