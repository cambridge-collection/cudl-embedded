# Things which we might like to do

* Split player.js up into individual files, using AMD modules
* Use Bower to manage dependencies rather than including them in the repo
* Use hashed filenames for referenced resources (like fonts) so that we can
  cache them for a long time.
* Use a consistent name for the viewer/player (rather than viewer/player)

## Speculative

* Allow specifying a specific region & rotation of a page to start at
